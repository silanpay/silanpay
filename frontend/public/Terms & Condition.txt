SILAN SOFTWARE acts as a facilitator, enabling individuals and legal entities to accept 
payments initiated by their customers on their respective websites or mobile applications, 
directed to the SILAN SOFTWARE site, or via various approved payment mechanisms such 
as Net Banking and other acceptable payment modes.

 



SILAN SOFTWARE is a software platform (“Software Application”) supported by the SILAN 
SOFTWARE website. In its role, SILAN SOFTWARE serves as an intermediary, establishing a 
connection between the Merchant Site and the relevant Acquiring Banks via the Software 
Application and the SILAN SOFTWARE website, to facilitate payments of Customer Charges 
for Transactions carried out through the Merchant's website, using the services of the 
Acquiring Banks (“Internet Payment Gateway”). To fulfill this role, SILAN SOFTWARE has 
entered into agreements with various Acquiring Banks, Nodal Banks, financial institutions, 
and other software providers engaged in offering IT services, including but not limited to 
internet-based electronic commerce, internet payment gateway services, and electronic 
software distribution systems. These partnerships allow for the routing of internet-based 
Transactions, provision of net banking facilities, Authorization from Financial Institutions or 
other third-party clearing houses, and settlement of payment instructions initiated by the 
Buyers.

 
The Transactions are solely between you and your Customers, with SILAN SOFTWARE acting 
exclusively as an intermediary. It is expressly stated that SILAN SOFTWARE is NOT (i) a 
payment system provider as defined under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, 
(ii) a banking company as per the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, nor (iii) a non-banking 
financial company under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1938.

 
The relationship between SILAN SOFTWARE and you is based on a principal-to-principal 
agreement. No provision in this agreement shall be construed as creating any association, 
partnership, joint venture, principal-agent, master-servant, or employer-employee 
relationship between SILAN SOFTWARE and you, nor between any affiliates or subsidiaries 
of either party. Moreover, neither party shall possess any rights, powers, or authority, 
whether express or implied, to establish any duty or obligation on behalf of the other. 
SILAN SOFTWARE maintains no direct or indirect interest in your business operations or the 
products offered/marketed on the Merchant Site. SILAN SOFTWARE provides its services to 
you as an independent entity and according to the terms and conditions outlined in this 
Agreement. SILAN SOFTWARE does not maintain any direct relationship with the 
Customers, and all actions taken under this Agreement that affect Customers are based on 
your instructions. You assume full responsibility for your Customers, and neither SILAN 
SOFTWARE nor any Acquiring Bank nor any party connected to SILAN SOFTWARE or the 
Acquiring Banks shall bear any liability towards the Customers. You agree to fully indemnify 
SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Bank at all times in respect of any such matters.

 
### 1.7 CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRITY OF HOTLINK

 
You shall bear full responsibility, at your own expense, for providing and maintaining all 
necessary equipment, software, and facilities to establish and sustain the connection 



between the Merchant website software and the Software Application.

 
You must take all required precautions and implement measures as prescribed by SILAN 
SOFTWARE from time to time to ensure that the security and integrity of the link between 
the Merchant Site and the Internet Payment Gateway ("Hotlink") remain uncompromised. 
You are obligated to ensure that all Customers accessing the Hotlink are directed to the 
Internet Payment Gateway without interruption. Additionally, you must deploy adequate 
encryption protocols and robust security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or 
hacking attempts targeting Customer information and related data. Furthermore, you shall 
comply with the security practices and procedures outlined in the Information Technology 
Act, 2000, and its associated rules and regulations, as well as the guidelines issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or any other applicable regulatory authority.

 
In the event of any loss, damage, or claim incurred by you, SILAN SOFTWARE, or the 
Acquiring Bank as a result of a breach of the Hotlink due to inadequate security measures 
on your part—whether from you, your employees, contractors, agents, or from the 
Merchant Site itself—you shall bear the full financial responsibility. You agree to indemnify, 
defend, and hold harmless SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Banks from any claims, 
actions, damages, or losses arising out of or concerning such incidents.

 
Additionally, you are required to routinely verify the integrity of the Hotlink at such 
intervals as specified by SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Banks. You must provide the 
necessary reports and conduct tests as may be requested by SILAN SOFTWARE or the 
Acquiring Banks to ensure continuous compliance with these requirements.

 
### 1.8 AUTHORIZATION AND AUTHENTICATION OF TRANSACTIONS

 
The Acquiring Bank shall authenticate, authorize, and process the payment instructions 
provided by the Customers on the Merchant's Website concerning the Transactions, subject 
to the fulfillment of the valid criteria set forth by the Acquiring Banks as may be amended 
from time to time. Upon successful authorization, the approved Customer Charge will be 
transferred from the Customer's Bank Account or Wallet to the Nodal Account.

 
SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Banks may, at their sole discretion, reject any 
Transaction authorization initiated by the Customer for reasons including, but not limited 
to, risk management protocols, suspicion of fraudulent or illegal activities, the sale of 
prohibited items, the use of compromised, the use of blacklisted or in compliance with the 
applicable regulations, guidelines, or directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 



Acquiring Banks, Issuing Institutions, and any other governing laws, rules, or regulations in 
force within the territory of India.

 
You hereby acknowledge that, as part of its risk management framework, SILAN SOFTWARE 
or the Acquiring Banks retain the right to impose limitations or restrictions on transaction 
size, amount, and monthly volume at any given time. These restrictions may include, but 
are not limited to, limits on the number of purchases permitted on an individual net 
banking account within a specified period, rejection of payments for Customer Orders 
originating from accounts with a history of suspicious or questionable charges, or 
Transactions exhibiting unusual monetary value. Furthermore, as an added security 
measure, SILAN SOFTWARE reserves the right to block any account numbers or

or any other such entities or criteria deemed necessary for effective risk mitigation.

confirmed, and the Transaction shall be considered complete ("SILAN SOFTWARE 
Completion of Transaction"). The transfer of the Settlement Amount to the Merchant Bank 
Account shall be contingent upon reconciliation of the Customer Charge by the Acquiring 
Banks, SILAN SOFTWARE, and the Nodal Bank following the actual receipt of the Customer 
Charge into the Nodal Account.

 
You shall bear sole responsibility for any payments related to refunds and Chargebacks, 
and SILAN SOFTWARE shall not be liable for any claims, disputes, penalties, or liabilities 
arising in connection with such refunds or Chargebacks to either you or the Customer. You 
agree to indemnify and hold SILAN SOFTWARE harmless against any claims, disputes, 
penalties, costs, and expenses arising, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to refunds 
or Chargebacks for all Transactions initiated through the Merchant Site.

 
Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that 
SILAN SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Bank, and the Nodal Bank reserve the right to reject 
payments related to any Customer Charge for reasons including, but not limited to, 
unlawful or erroneous Transactions, Chargebacks, refunds, fraud, suspicious activities, 
issues related to Authentication and Authorization, overpayments due to mathematical 
errors, penalties incurred, delivery issues, Customer Charge disputes, or non-compliance 
with the requirements of SILAN SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Banks, and the financial 
Association.

 
In the event of rejection of payment for a Customer Charge, Chargeback, refund, or other 
Outstanding Amounts owed to SILAN SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Bank, or the Customer, 
SILAN SOFTWARE or the Acquiring Bank reserve the right to reverse any credit extended to 
the Merchant Bank Account or offset the rejected payment amount, Chargeback, refund, or 
Outstanding Amount against the Settlement Amount payable to you. Additionally, SILAN 
SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Banks may deduct such payment amounts from future 
Settlement Amounts due to you for subsequent Transactions.



 
All Settlement Amounts owed to you under this Agreement may be suspended or delayed 
at the discretion of SILAN SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Banks, and the Nodal Bank if any of the 
following conditions arise: (a) you, your Customer, or a third party engages in fraud or 
violates any applicable laws or legal requirements; (b) SILAN SOFTWARE or the Acquiring 
Banks have reasonable grounds to suspect fraudulent activities against the Customers, 
SILAN SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Banks, or any third party by you, your Customers, or any 
other related parties; (c) you exhibit excessive Chargebacks or present high Chargeback 
and refund risk; (d) there is consistent non-delivery or delayed delivery of Products to 
Customers; or (e) for any other legitimate reason deemed appropriate by SILAN SOFTWARE 
or the Acquiring Banks.

 
### 1.13 RESERVE – Financial Security and Withholding Rights

 
You hereby acknowledge and agree that SILAN SOFTWARE PRIVATE LIMITED (“SILAN 
SOFTWARE”) reserves the right, at its sole discretion and at any time, to temporarily 
suspend or delay any payments due to you or to require the establishment and 
maintenance of a monetary reserve (“Reserve”) in such amount as may be reasonably 
determined by SILAN SOFTWARE. This Reserve may be required as a measure to secure the 
fulfillment of your payment obligations under this Agreement and may be imposed for 
reasons including, but not limited to: elevated chargeback ratios, credit exposure, refund or 
overdraft risks, issues pertaining to non-delivery of goods or services, the sale of prohibited 
or regulated items, unpaid service or maintenance fees, or any other circumstances that 
reasonably indicate the potential for non-performance or financial instability in connection 
with your use of the SILAN SOFTWARE services.

 
Failure to provide the Reserve within seven (7) days from receipt of written notice shall 
entitle SILAN SOFTWARE, without further obligation of notice, to suspend or terminate any 
settlement payouts or restrict access to SILAN SOFTWARE services. The Reserve may be 
applied, at the discretion of SILAN SOFTWARE, towards the satisfaction of any outstanding 
obligations, including but not limited to, amounts owed to SILAN SOFTWARE, acquiring 
banks, or your customers.

 
In the event that the settlement proceeds and the Reserve are insufficient to cover your 
total outstanding liability, you shall be required to immediately remit the remaining 
balance to SILAN SOFTWARE and the acquiring bank upon demand. Interest shall accrue on 
such outstanding sums at the rate of 1.5% per month, calculated daily, commencing from 
the date of demand until full payment is made. The right of SILAN SOFTWARE to apply the 
Reserve and enforce such set-off rights shall be without prejudice to, and in addition to, 
any other legal or equitable remedies available under applicable law.



 
Furthermore, you agree to indemnify and reimburse SILAN SOFTWARE for all reasonable 
costs and expenses incurred in relation to the recovery of such dues, including but not 
limited to attorney’s fees, legal expenses, and collection agency charges.

 
### 1.14 CHARGEBACK LIABILITY, RIGHTS, AND REMEDIES

 
1. *Right to Recover Chargebacks and Associated Liabilities*  

   In the event that any transaction processed through SILAN SOFTWARE results in a 
chargeback, SILAN SOFTWARE shall have the absolute and irrevocable right to withhold the 
full amount of such chargeback, together with any associated fees, fines, penalties, or 
related costs, by setting aside such sums in a designated Reserve. SILAN SOFTWARE may, at 
its sole discretion, debit such amounts from the Merchant’s Settlement Amount or Reserve. 
 

   Should SILAN SOFTWARE reasonably anticipate that a chargeback may arise in relation to a 
specific transaction, it shall be entitled to withhold an amount equivalent to the potential 
chargeback from any payments due to the Merchant under this Agreement until one of the 
following occurs:  

   (a) a chargeback is formally assessed by reason of a customer dispute, in which case the 
withheld funds shall be retained by SILAN SOFTWARE;  

   (b) the lapse of any statutory or regulatory timeframe, or the expiration of time limits 
stipulated under Rules within which the customer may initiate a chargeback; or  

   (c) SILAN SOFTWARE determines, at its sole discretion, that the risk of chargeback no 
longer exists.  

   In circumstances where recovery of the chargeback amount proves unsuccessful, the 
Merchant shall remain unconditionally liable to remit the full chargeback sum to SILAN 
SOFTWARE immediately upon demand. The Merchant agrees to bear all legal and collection 
costs, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and related expenses, incurred by SILAN 
SOFTWARE in the recovery of unpaid or outstanding amounts.

 
2. *Management of Excessive Chargebacks*  

   Should SILAN SOFTWARE, in its sole and absolute discretion, determine that the Merchant 
is incurring an excessive volume of chargebacks, SILAN SOFTWARE shall be entitled to 
implement additional control measures and conditions with respect to the processing of 
transactions. These may include, but are not limited to:  

   (a) the imposition of revised or increased processing fees;  
   (b) the establishment or augmentation of a Reserve in an amount deemed sufficient to 

cover anticipated chargebacks and ancillary costs;  
   (c) the deferral or delay of settlement payouts; and  
   (d) the suspension or immediate termination of services provided under this Agreement.



 
3. *Resolution and Contestation of Disputed Transactions*  

   Upon receipt of a chargeback notification concerning a transaction, SILAN SOFTWARE shall 
promptly notify the Merchant of the same. The Merchant shall be required to conduct an 
internal investigation and, within five (5) calendar days of receiving such notice, shall 
provide SILAN SOFTWARE with a written response, stating either of the following:  

   i. A formal request instructing SILAN SOFTWARE to refund the transaction amount to the 
customer (“Refund Request”), or;  

   ii. A comprehensive rebuttal explaining the legitimacy of the transaction, accompanied by 
all relevant documentary evidence necessary to dispute the chargeback.  

   Failure by the Merchant to respond within the stipulated timeframe, or submission of 
inadequate or unsatisfactory evidence, shall entitle SILAN SOFTWARE to treat the 
chargeback as valid. In such an event, SILAN SOFTWARE shall be authorized to recover the 
chargeback amount from future Settlement Amounts, the Reserve (if any), or any other 
receivables. In the event of insufficient funds, the Merchant shall be liable to remit the 
unrecovered portion forthwith upon demand.  

   It is expressly acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that any Transaction Discount Rate 
(TDR) or fee levied by SILAN SOFTWARE in respect of a confirmed transaction shall not be 
refunded, irrespective of whether such transaction is subsequently disputed, refunded, 
charged back, or reversed.

 
### 1.15 Terms Of EMI Facility

 
You acknowledge and agree that in order to avail the Equated Monthly Installment (“EMI”) 
services extended by a financial institution or issuing bank, you must obtain explicit 
approval from such institution. The provision of EMI services shall be governed entirely by 
the terms and conditions of the respective bank and SILAN SOFTWARE PRIVATE LIMITED 
(“SILAN SOFTWARE”), and shall be offered strictly at their discretion. It shall be your sole 
responsibility to ensure that, during the course of any transaction, the Customer also 
accepts and consents to such applicable terms and conditions related to EMI offerings.

 
You further acknowledge that, at the time of completing a transaction, the full transaction 
amount shall be charged to the Customer. SILAN SOFTWARE shall, within two (2) Business 
Days from the date of completion of the transaction, forward the relevant transaction 
details to the concerned bank for conversion into EMI. Once submitted, EMI transactions 
shall be deemed irrevocable and cannot be cancelled or reversed under any circumstances.

 
In the event that EMI payment options are extended to Customers, you shall ensure that 
products or services are delivered only after receipt of approval from the Issuing 
Institution. SILAN SOFTWARE shall not be held liable for any claim, loss, or dispute arising 



from the Issuing Institution’s refusal to approve the EMI facility, regardless of whether the 
Settlement Amount is retained in the Nodal Bank account or already remitted to your 
designated Merchant Bank Account. Any grievances related to rejection of the EMI 
application must be addressed by the Customer directly with the Issuing Institution.

 
You explicitly understand that the conversion of transactions into EMI shall be facilitated 
through an offline mechanism. The Issuing Institution shall endeavor, on a best-effort 
basis, to convert the eligible transactions into EMI within five (5) Business Days of 
submission. You shall further ensure the availability of an accurate EMI calculator on the 
Merchant Site to transparently communicate the EMI breakdown and applicable interest 
rates to the Customer.

 
You also acknowledge that the Issuing Institution reserves the sole and absolute right to 
amend the terms of the EMI facility, or to suspend or withdraw the EMI offering at any 
time, without prior notice. Neither SILAN SOFTWARE nor any Acquiring Bank shall bear any 
liability for non-conversion of a transaction into EMI, or for any failure to notify you or the 
Customer regarding the rejection of the EMI request by the Issuing Institution.

 
### 1.16 Fulfilment and Delivery Obligations

 
The Merchant hereby agrees and undertakes that dispatch or rendering of any goods or 
services (hereinafter referred to as “Products”) to the Customer shall only be effected 
subsequent to the receipt of an express transaction confirmation from SILAN SOFTWARE. 
Such confirmation shall be deemed valid only upon successful receipt of corresponding 
authorization and transaction confirmation from the relevant Acquiring Bank by SILAN 
SOFTWARE. The Merchant expressly acknowledges and accepts that SILAN SOFTWARE 
bears no liability whatsoever for any transaction that has not been confirmed to SILAN 
SOFTWARE by the respective Acquiring Bank.

 
The Merchant shall maintain verifiable and legally admissible Proof of Delivery for every 
Transaction initiated via the Merchant’s platform for a minimum retention period of one (1) 
year from the date of actual delivery of the Product. Such Proof of Delivery shall remain 
accessible and subject to inspection by SILAN SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Bank, and the 
designated Nodal Bank during standard business hours on any working day.

 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary within this Agreement, the Merchant 
acknowledges that SILAN SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Bank, and the Nodal Bank shall have 
the irrevocable right to request and examine Proof of Delivery at any time, whether prior to 



or subsequent to the disbursement of the Settlement Amount into the Merchant’s 
designated bank account. Failure to furnish valid Proof of Delivery as stipulated herein may 
result in a reversal of the respective Customer Charge or a rejection thereof, at the sole 
discretion of SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Bank.

 
The Merchant further agrees to execute delivery of the Product strictly within the timeline 
(hereinafter referred to as the “Delivery Due Date”) as specified at the time the transaction 
is consummated on the Merchant’s platform. In the event that the Merchant is unable to 
fulfil delivery, whether in part or in full, by the stated Delivery Due Date, the Merchant shall 
promptly notify the Customer and initiate a full or partial refund of the Customer Charge in 
accordance with the Customer’s instructions.

 
All risks associated with the delivery of Products, including but not limited to damage, 
delay, non-fulfilment, or quality disputes, shall be borne exclusively by the Merchant. Any 
claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with such matters shall be resolved 
directly between the Merchant and the Customer, and under no circumstances shall SILAN 
SOFTWARE, the Acquiring Bank, or any of their affiliates be named as a party to such 
disputes or held liable in relation thereto.

 
### 1.17 REFUNDS AND RETURNS POLICY

 
By using the services provided by SILAN SOFTWARE, you hereby agree to adhere to and 
process any returns, refunds, or adjustments for Products sold and payments collected via 
the Merchant Site in full compliance with this Agreement, the directives of the Acquiring 
Banks, and the applicable Financial Institutions Rules. In this regard, you are obligated to: 
(a) uphold a reasonable and transparent refund, cancellation, or adjustment policy; (b) duly 
inform Buyers of the return or cancellation policy; (c) refrain from issuing cash refunds to 
Buyers for transactions, unless mandated by law; and (d) ensure that no cash or equivalent 
items of value are accepted as part of sale refund.

 
The refund or adjustment amount must encompass any taxes associated with the 
transaction and must not exceed the total value displayed on the original sales record, 
except for the precise amount necessary to reimburse the Customer for postage costs 
incurred when returning merchandise. In instances where the Customer opts for returns 
and requests an unequal exchange of Products (e.g., differing sales prices), a credit must 
be issued for the entire value of the returned Products, and a new sale must be processed 
for any newly selected Products. Please be advised that, should your refund policy be 
restrictive or fail to meet Customer expectations, you may still face a chargeback related to 
such transactions.



 
### 1.18 CUSTOMER SUPPORT

 
All customer service matters relating to transactions, products sold on your Merchant Site, 
including but not limited to customer charges, order fulfillment, order cancellations, 
returns, refunds, adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty inquiries, technical 
support, and feedback regarding experiences with your personnel, policies, or processes, 
shall remain your sole responsibility. In providing customer support, you shall at all times 
present yourself as a separate and independent entity from SILAN SOFTWARE.

 
You are obligated to provide customer support during all business days. This support must 
include appropriate means for customers to contact you, including, but not limited to, 
email address and telephone number, in the event the customer has inquiries regarding 
the nature or quality of the product or the procedures for resolving disputes. Under no 
circumstances shall SILAN SOFTWARE be held responsible for providing customer support 
to customers or any third parties.

 
## Merchant Risk Assessment and Liability

 
SILAN SOFTWARE reserves the right to conduct periodic and ongoing risk assessments 
(hereinafter referred to as "Risk Assessment") during the term of this Agreement. These 
Risk Assessments are undertaken to evaluate the integrity of your business operations, 
transactions, and overall compliance with applicable legal and regulatory standards. The 
Risk Assessment will be performed for, but not limited to, the following purposes:

 
1. To verify that your business is duly constituted and operates in accordance with 
legitimate and lawful practices.
2. To assess that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection and security of 
Customer Data, in compliance with applicable data protection laws and industry standards.
3. To evaluate and investigate any instances of fraud, default, or discrepancies relating to 
the Transactions on your Merchant Site.
4. To provide SILAN SOFTWARE with any assurances it may reasonably require regarding its 
exposure under this Agreement and any related agreements with Acquiring Banks and 
financial institutions.

 
You agree to cooperate fully by providing all reasonable assistance and necessary 
information to SILAN SOFTWARE in the execution of such Risk Assessments. Furthermore, 
we may periodically obtain additional reports to ensure your continued adherence to the 



terms and conditions of this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement, you authorize SILAN 
SOFTWARE to collect, share, and exchange information about your business and 
Transactions with relevant Acquiring Banks, Issuing Institutions, financial institutions, and 
government authorities. This includes sharing data regarding (a) your Transactions for 
regulatory compliance, including Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, (b) information 
necessary for the ongoing management and maintenance of the Service, (c) to update 
customer records and better serve you, and (d) to support SILAN SOFTWARE’s internal risk 
management processes.

 
Should a Risk Assessment reveal, or if we reasonably determine at any point, that you 
present a material credit risk or otherwise pose an increased risk to SILAN SOFTWARE's 
exposure under this Agreement, we reserve the right to take any of the following actions:

 
1. Terminate this Agreement with immediate effect.
2. Suspend or defer any payments due to you for a period deemed necessary by SILAN 
SOFTWARE to mitigate the identified risk, with such deferred payments potentially being 
applied towards any amounts owed by you under this Agreement.
3. In the event of fraudulent activities, whether directly by you or in collusion with others, 
or if any fraudulent Transactions are identified, SILAN SOFTWARE will report such activities 
to relevant governmental or law enforcement authorities.

 
By agreeing to these terms, you acknowledge and accept the possibility of such Risk 
Assessments and the actions SILAN SOFTWARE may take in response to potential risks, as 
outlined herein.

 
### 1.20 SECURITY DEPOSIT AS RESERVE

 
At any time, SILAN SOFTWARE reserves the right to request the Seller to provide an 
interest-free, refundable security deposit to be held as a reserve ("Reserve"), ensuring the 
Seller's compliance with their payment obligations under this Agreement. The Seller agrees 
to furnish such a security deposit upon request, as determined by SILAN SOFTWARE from 
time to time. SILAN SOFTWARE may suspend or delay Payments to the Seller or request a 
security deposit for reasons including, but not limited to, elevated chargeback risk, refund 
activity, non-payment of maintenance fees, or any other indicators of performance issues 
related to the Seller's use of the Service. The security deposit will be set at an amount 
deemed reasonable by SILAN SOFTWARE, based on anticipated chargebacks, returns, 
unshipped products, unfulfilled services, or credit risks, in accordance with the Seller's 
processing history and a Risk Assessment, or as determined by Payment System Providers.



 
SILAN SOFTWARE reserves the right to adjust the amount of the security deposit, either 
increasing, decreasing, or removing it entirely, at its sole discretion. This may be influenced 
by the Seller’s payment history, a credit review, the amount of any arbitration award, or 
court judgment rendered against the Seller in favor of SILAN SOFTWARE, or as deemed 
necessary by SILAN SOFTWARE or the Payment System Providers. Should the Seller fail to 
provide the requested security deposit within five (5) days of receiving a notice from SILAN 
SOFTWARE, the Seller’s account may be suspended or terminated without further notice.

 
The Reserve may be utilized by SILAN SOFTWARE to recover losses, costs, damages, 
chargebacks, returns, penalties, or other expenses incurred by SILAN SOFTWARE, the 
Buyers, or Payment System Providers due to fraud, misconduct, negligence, service 
deficiencies, or any other circumstances as determined by SILAN SOFTWARE. This may 
include deductions for any outstanding Fees owed by the Seller to SILAN SOFTWARE.

 
The security deposit will be refunded to the Seller after a period of 180 days from the 
Seller's last transaction date, provided that the Seller’s account is closed and no 
outstanding or negative balances remain.

 
### 1.21 Inspection and Audit Rights

 
You are required to maintain and retain accurate records of periodic checks in the manner 
prescribed by SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Banks. SILAN SOFTWARE and the 
Acquiring Banks reserve the right to audit and inspect your records, statements, and 
related documents to ensure compliance with your obligations under this Agreement at 
intervals or times deemed appropriate by SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Banks. 
Furthermore, SILAN SOFTWARE and the Acquiring Banks may inspect your business 
premises. In the event that you refuse or obstruct such inspections, SILAN SOFTWARE 
reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your account. Additionally, SILAN 
SOFTWARE retains the authority to suspend or terminate the services of any user who 
provides inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information, or fails to meet the registration 
requirements outlined for the SILAN SOFTWARE Account. Any refusal of inspection or 
failure to comply with the terms and conditions stipulated in this Agreement may result in 
the immediate suspension or termination of your access to SILAN SOFTWARE Services.
