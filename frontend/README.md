This repository is an automated, best-effort conversion of the uploaded TypeScript React project to JavaScript (JSX).

What I did:
- Renamed .tsx -> .jsx and .ts -> .js
- Applied regex transformations to remove TypeScript syntax (types, interfaces, generics).
- Created a backend/ Express skeleton with basic routes.

IMPORTANT:
- Automated conversion is not perfect. Please run the project locally and check console/build errors.
- Common fixes you may need to apply manually:
  - Re-add PropTypes or JSDoc for prop validation.
  - Fix remaining type-specific expressions not removed by regex.
  - Update imports for assets/css if build errors occur.

How to run:
- Frontend: `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the frontend directory (root contains package.json if present).
- Backend: `cd backend && npm install && npm run dev`

If you want, I can now go file-by-file to fix remaining errors â€” tell me to "fix build errors" after you try running it.
